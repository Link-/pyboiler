# PyBoiler
PyBoiler is a simple python 2.7 script to create a project template in a given directory.

### Version

    alpha-0.4.0

### Installation

	pip install pyboiler

### Usage
PyBoiler is extremely simple to use. 

##### Create a JSON file to match the folder structure you desire:

    $: nano structure.json 
    
    # Paste the below into your file and modify as you desire
	[{'folder': 'source'}, 
     {'file': 'source/file1.txt'}, # Nested file
     {'folder': 'sublime'}, 
     {'file': 'sublime/file2.txt'}, 
     {'folder': 'docs'}, 
     {'file': 'docs/file3.txt'}, 
     {'file': 'docs/file4.txt'},
     {'file': 'README.md'}]

##### How to execute

	usage: pyboiler.py [-h] -o PROJECT_PATH

	required arguments:
  		-o PROJECT_PATH, --project-directory PROJECT_PATH 
  				Project's absolute path where the structure will be created  		
                        	
    optional arguments:
      	-h, --help 	
      			Show this help message and exit
      			
        -s FOLDER_STRUCTURE, --folder-structure FOLDER_STRUCTURE
                JSON file containing the template folder/file
                structure to be created

Note: If the argument `-i` is not specified the script will use the default template (hardcoded)
